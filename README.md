# OrlandoVMUG2018
Everything from my 4:15pm-5:00pm talk on "Power CLI vCommunity Resources Used to Migrate to VCSA 6.5"

This will be updated as best as I can muster, with cleaner code and some further explainations.

If you were at the event, feel free to pull and change this as you need.

You'll need to modify it to your liking, so be careful!

Enjoy!
